This project aims to predict coronary artery disease using machine learning models trained on key clinical features such as age, cholesterol levels, and chest pain type. Various algorithms, including ensemble methods, were implemented and evaluated to enhance prediction accuracy. A real-time interface was developed for clinical use, enabling quick and reliable risk assessment. The system supports early diagnosis, helping healthcare professionals make informed decisions for improved patient care.
